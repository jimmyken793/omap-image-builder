# Output file generation
# Files are generated, copied to the deploy/ directory, and tar'd
# If the file "release" exists in the base directory
#   Source packages are downloaded
#   The file is copied to the RCN compression "farm"
# Else if the file "compress" exists in the base directory
#   The tar file is xz compressed
#   The tar.zx file is moved to $release_dir
#   If release_dir is empty, the xz file is left in the deploy/ directory
